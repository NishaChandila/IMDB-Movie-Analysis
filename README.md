## EDA and Data Cleaning
In our movie dataset analysis, we performed several key data cleaning steps to ensure accuracy and relevance. Irrelevant columns were dropped, and data was processed to focus on critical metrics. We created an **ROI visualization** to evaluate the relationship between budget and revenue, helping to identify the most profitable movies.

A **scatter plot** was used to explore the correlation between vote average and popularity, revealing how audience ratings influence a movie’s popularity. We also analyzed movie genres, splitting them to examine the performance of each genre individually. This allowed us to assess the popularity of each genre and determine which ones contribute the most to revenue.

Finally, we checked **monthly revenue trends** to uncover patterns and identify peak revenue periods. These analyses provide a comprehensive view of how different factors such as genre, ratings, and popularity impact a movie’s financial performance.
